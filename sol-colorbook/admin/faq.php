    <h2>SOL Coloring Book: FAQ</h2>
    <br />
    <b>Why does each coloring page have a logo overlapping the bottom right corner?</b><br />
    This was originally designed for our site: mySummerSol.com, and we decided to make it available (for free) but did not remove the logo.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Can the logo on the coloring pages be removed or can I replace it with my own logo?</b><br />
    Currently, there is no setting where the logo can be removed or replaced, but using the "Print" button will remove the logo when printing the coloring pages. 
    In the future we will be making it possible to change the logo and even link to your own SVG logo. <br>
    Meanwhile, if you really need it removed or replaced, we can remove or replace it for you for $35 (pay via paypal). <br>
    If you need an SVG created of your logo we can take your existing logo (AI, JPG, or other image format) and create it for you. We will have to see the logo to give you an estimate of how much we would charge. (pay via paypal). <br>

    <b>I don't want to delete a page, but I do not want it to display. How do I do that?</b><br />
    You can deactivate/activate the coloring book pages in the table (see the Active column)<br>
    <br />
    <b>The default SVG coloring pages worked, but mine shows up weird, stretched, or just funky, and the colors show up below the image. What am I doing wrong?</b><br />
    Nothing. This was designed to only work for SVG's with a specific width and height of 600x800 pixels.
    Also, a full width page of 880px is what is needed for this to work, but is not required.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Does this work with responsive design?</b><br />
    It should as long as the full normal view of the page is 880px wide or wider. This was designed to relocate its own elements or change their sizes to work on various media. In some cases the colors and tools move below the image. Please let us know if it doesn't and we will do what we can to correct it.<br />
